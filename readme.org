#+TITLE: Learning Django
I decided to learn pyhton by learning django. I've been blogging and creating sites in WordPress for over a decade. The direction the WordPress core is heading is fine but I feel like I'm fighting it more and more. That I have to have a separate plugin to keep the editor from mangling my markup is frustrating. The Gutenberg editor made me want to scream. This is all my own problem and isn't a judgement on the WP Developers. What am I writing this in? Spacemacs.

Eventually I'll try [[http://mezzanine.jupo.org/][Mezzanine]] but for now I'd like to keep this as vanilla as possible. 

This project is using:

- Django 2.1.2
- jQuery 3.3.1
- FontAwesome 5.3.1
- Bootstrap 4.1.3

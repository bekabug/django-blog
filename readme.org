#+TITLE: Learning Django
About 8 months ago I decided to learn Python. I hacked around a little on some different "lern 2 code" tutorials. The best way to learn is by doing so I'm learning Python now by learning Django. 

I've been blogging and creating sites in WordPress and other platforms since the early 2000s (b2/b2 evolution era). The direction the WordPress core is heading these days is fine but I feel like I'm fighting it more than creating with it. That I have to have a separate plugin to keep the editor from mangling my markup is frustrating. The Gutenberg editor made me want to scream. This is all my own problem and isn't a judgement on the WP Developers. What am I writing this in? Spacemacs. That should tell you something...

Eventually I'll try [[http://mezzanine.jupo.org/][Mezzanine]] but for now I'd like to keep this as vanilla as possible. 

This project is using:

- Django 2.1.2
- jQuery 3.3.1
- FontAwesome 5.3.1
- Bootstrap 4.1.3

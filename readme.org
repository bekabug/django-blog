I decided to learn pyhton by learning django and now here we are.

  CLOCK: [2018-10-13 Sat 22:02]--[2018-10-13 Sat 22:02] =>  0:00
  :END:
Upgraded to Django 2.1.2, added badges to the readme (i hope)

** October 5, 2018
   Flat pages are working now. Used a boilerplate default.html and copied boot strap theme examples. I'd eventually like to use a living style guide but this will do for now.

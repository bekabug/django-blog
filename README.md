# My "First" Blog

### September 21, 2018
It's actually my first *django* blog.

### September 30, 2018
Blog is now bootstrapped, responsive, and Tiffany blue.

### October 2, 2018
Upgraded to Django 2.1.2, added badges to the readme (i hope)

### October 5, 2018
Flat pages are working now. Used a boilerplate default.html and copied boot strap theme examples. I'd eventually like to use a living style guide but this will do for now. 

----------------------------------------------

#### Goals for this week:
- [ ] More styles
- [x] ~~Static~~ Flat pages
